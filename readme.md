List Comprehension is a way to construct a new Python list from an iterable types: lists, tuples, and strings. All without using a for loop or the `.append()` list method.

In this project,program that takes a camelCase or PascalCase formatted string as input and converts that to a snake_case formatted string using two approaches. First, for loop and then list comprehension to achieve the same results. You'll see how list comprehension can make your code more concise.
